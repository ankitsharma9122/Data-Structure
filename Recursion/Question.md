## Easy : 
**Questions based on pick/not-pick:**

1. [Generate all valid parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses)

* Time & Space : 2^n / o(n) [Maxium depth of tree]
* Note : When ever their is and condition in base case check twice for recursive call , will infinite call caise MLE.

2. [subsequences sum equal to k ](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets)
* same as Question 1 just make sure to return 1,0.

Note : subset where target is not fixed
3. [Find all Subset sum(subset sum 1)](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets)
* Time & Space : 2^n / o(n) [Maxium depth of tree]

4. [Generate all Binary String](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-binary-strings-without-adjacent-zeros/description/)

* same as Question 3. 

5.  [Combination sum 1](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/description/)
